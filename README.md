# Homework assignment

In this homework assignment I tackled some pretty simple data extraction and saved the result in a postgreSQL database. 
I did my best to write clean code.

### main.py
Contains the main logic for loading config, processing data and querying DB.

### db.py
Contains logic for accessing DB as well as creating a table.

### helpers.py
Contains a helper function, with potential to expand in the future.

## Before running
Modify your username and db_name for connecting to a DB in main.py
